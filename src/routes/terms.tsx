        <h2>1. Agreement</h2>
        <p>By using spicytrade, you agree to these terms, the <Link to="/privacy">Privacy Policy</Link>, and the <Link to="/disclosures">Risk Disclosures</Link>, which are part of these terms. If you do not agree, do not use spicytrade.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>2. Acceptable use</h2>
        <p>Use spicytrade only lawfully and only through accounts you are authorized to use. You are responsible for your sign-in methods, agent tokens, brokerage credentials, and devices. Do not probe, bypass, overload, or interfere with spicytrade or another user’s data.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>3. No advice; your trades are yours</h2>
        <p>spicytrade is software. It does not give personalized investment, legal, tax, or accounting advice and is not a fiduciary. When your agent asks it to, spicytrade places orders through your own brokerage credentials; you make every decision, bear every loss, and should verify orders, fills, and prices with your broker. Your broker and other providers control their own services, data, executions, fees, and terms.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Changes and availability</h2>
        <p>spicytrade may change, be interrupted, or be withdrawn at any time. We may update these terms by posting a new effective date; using spicytrade afterward means you accept them.</p>
      </section>
      <section>
        <h2>5. No warranty; limited liability</h2>
