 * plain refetch of a small document. Hashed assets stay immutable via `_headers`.
 *
 * Once per browser, the document also asks the browser itself to drop everything it stores
 * for this origin. An obsolete service worker held phones on a dead build, and page code could
 * not retire it: on WebKit the worker stalled the very module that would have run the fix, and
 * the registration API the inline guard falls back on hung with it. `Clear-Site-Data` is
 * processed by the browser's network layer before the document commits, so it needs nothing
 * of ours to run. "storage" unregisters service workers and empties the Cache API along with
 * localStorage, sessionStorage, and IndexedDB; "cache" drops the HTTP cache too, so the next
 * load is entirely current. The price is one cold start per browser per generation: the saved
 * market re-syncs, the selected ticker resets, and favorites a visitor staged without signing
 * in are gone — they are the only state that lives nowhere else. Cookies survive, so the owner
 * stays signed in and the receipt below is what stops the purge repeating. A fetch made without
 * credentials never carries the receipt and is purged again on purpose: that is how the old
 * worker refreshed its shell, and a purge it triggers itself is the best outcome available.
 * The guard clears the receipt before its own reload for the same reason.
